description: >
  The SEC principal has contracted services with over 1 GW of projects and directly
  overseen the development, engineering, management, construction, and commissioning
  of more than 150 MW of operational utility scale and commercial solar PV assets. SEC has
  worked on projects throughout the U.S. Including the states of California, Nevada,
  Arizona, Idaho, Oregon, Indiana, Maryland, Vermont, and Massachusetts.  We possess
  vast experience navigating all stages of the solar and energy storage project lifecycle
  including development, entitlements, design optimization, interconnection, engineering,
  construction, commissioning, and O&M facets of the project life cycle.  Below is a
  sampling of SEC project experience.
