  The SEC principal has contracted services with over 1 GW of projects, having directly
  overseen the development, engineering, management, construction, and commissioning of
  more than 150 MW of operational commercial and utility scale solar PV assets.  SEC has
  worked on projects throughout the U.S. Including the states of California, Nevada,
  Arizona, Idaho, Oregon, Indiana, Maryland, Vermont, and Massachusetts.  We possess
  vast experience navigating all stages of the solar and energy storage project lifecycle
  including development, entitlements, design optimization, interconnection, engineering,
  construction, commissioning, and O&M facets of the project life cycle.  Below is a
  sampling of SEC project experience.
