heading: ASTM E2848 Capacity Testing

Solar Engineering Consultants has overseen capacity testing of more than 800 MW
of operational power plants. ASTM E2848 has set a test standard and procedure by
which solar system performance can be measured against modeled system performance
during the commissioning stage. This Performance or Capacity Testing is typically
one of the last steps in the commissioning process. Typically, the Capacity Testing
procedure will be defined in the context of an EPC contract or exhibit and based on
the ASTM E2848 procedure and sometimes also includes reference to the E2939 standard.
