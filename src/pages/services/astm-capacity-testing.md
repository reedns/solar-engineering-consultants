Solar Engineering Consultants has overseen performance and capacity testing of GW of operational power plants.   SEC has performance and capacity tested projects to procedures based on ASTM E2848 and IEC 61724-2 standards that compare measured and modeled system performance as a final step to commissioning.  Typically, the Capacity Testing procedure will be defined in the context of an EPC contract or exhibit and based on the ASTM E2848 or IEC 61724-2 standards.

Understanding the ASTM E2848 or IEC 61724 standards and the Performance Test procedure in an EPC contract can be a time-consuming endeavor.  SEC is intimately familiar with the ASTM E2848 and IEC 61724 standards, having performed testing on GW of projects using procedures based on these standards.  Leveraging the experience of SEC with Performance or Capacity Testing will save you time, headache, money, and frustration, ensuring you meet your Substantial Completion or Commercial Operation deadline.
